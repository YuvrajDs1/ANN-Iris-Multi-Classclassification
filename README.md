# Iris Flower Classification using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project implements an ANN model to classify iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** using the classic Iris dataset. It includes both the model training code using TensorFlow/Keras and a Streamlit web app for interactive prediction.

---

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Iris dataset with 150 samples, 4 features (`sepal length`, `sepal width`, `petal length`, `petal width`), and 3 target classes.
- **Model:** Sequential ANN with 2 hidden layers and softmax output layer for multiclass classification.
- **Training:** Model is trained with early stopping and TensorBoard callbacks.
- **Deployment:** Interactive Streamlit app allows users to input feature values via sliders and see prediction results along with probability distribution.
